This is a project that allows for someone to navigate to a set waypoint using haptic feedback.
A set of eight vibrating motors are located around the insole of a shoe.
This is the arduino code to interface a GPS and compass module with eight vibrating motors.
A waypoint can be set into the code and the motor pointing towards the waypoint will vibrate allowing the user to navigate in that direction.
In addition, there is an ultrasonic sensor on the front that can sense objects up to 2 meters away. Depending on how far the object is, a vibrating motor in the center of the shoe will vibrate with varying intensity to alert the user of a obstacle.
