This is a project that allows for someone to navigate to a set waypoint using haptic feedback.
A set of eight vibrating motors are located around the insole of a shoe.
This is the arduino code to interface a GPS and compass module with eight vibrating motors.
A waypoint can be set into the code and the motor pointing towards the waypoint will vibrate allowing the user to navigate in that direction.
